"We met at a coffee shop on a rainy Tuesday morning. Sarah was reading a book about astronomy, and I couldn't help but notice the constellation bookmark peeking out. That led to our first conversation about dreams, stars, and how we both believed in magic. Now, three years later, we still go stargazing every month on our anniversary date. She says I'm her North Star, and I know she's mine. We're both teachers who love traveling, and our dream is to see the Northern Lights together in Iceland next year."`
